1. In tenderness He sought me,\n
Weary and sick with sin,\n
And on His shoulders brought me\n
Back to His fold again.\n
While angels in His presence sang\n 
Until the courts of heaven rang.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, the love that sought me\n
Oh, the blood that bought me\n
Oh the grace that brought me to the fold.\n
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.\n\n
He pointed to the nail-prints;\n
For me His blood was shed.\n
A mocking crown so thorny,\n
Was placed upon His head.\n
I wonder what He saw in me,\n
To suffer such deep agony.\n\n
I’m sitting in His presence;\n
The sunshine of His face,\n 
While with adoring wonder\n
His wonders I retrace.\n
It seems as if eternal days\n
Are far too short to sound His praise.\n

2. O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder\n
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,\n
I see the stars; I hear the mighty thunder,\n
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee\n
How great thou art! How great Thou art!\n
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee\n
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!\n\n
And when I think: that God, His Son not sparing\n
Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in;\n
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing\n
He bled and died; to take away my sin.\n\n
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\n
And take me home – what joy shall fill my heart.\n 
Then shall I bow in humble adoration,\n
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art.\n

3. Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,\n
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;\n
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,\n
As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness;\n
Morning by morning new mercies I see;\n
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided,\n
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.\n\n
Summer, and winter, and spring time, and harvest,\n
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above;\n
Join with all nature in manifold witness,\n
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.\n\n
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\n
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;\n
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,\n
Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.\n

4. I hear the words of love,\n
I gaze upon the blood,\n
I see the mighty sacrifice,\n
And I have peace with God.\n\n
’Tis everlasting peace,\n
Sure as Jehovah’s name;\n
’Tis stable as His steadfast throne,\n
For evermore the same.\n\n
The clouds may go and come,\n
And storms may sweep my sky;\n
This blood - sealed friendship changes not,\n
The cross is ever nigh.\n\n
I change - He changes not;\n
The Christ can never die;\n
His love, not mine, the resting - place;\n
His truth, not mine, the tie.\n\n
My love is oft - times low,\n
My joy still ebbs and flows;\n
But peace with Him remains the same,\n
No change Jehovah knows.\n

5. Holy, holy, holy! Lord\n
God of Hosts! When heav’n and earth,\n
Out of darkness, at Thy Word,\n
Issued into glorious birth,\n
All Thy works before Thee stood,\n
And Thine eye beheld them good,\n
While they sang with sweet accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy, Lord!\n\n
Holy, holy, holy! Thee\n
One Jehovah evermore,\n
Father, Son, and Spirit, we\n
Dust and ashes, would adore;\n
Lightly by the world esteemed,\n
From that world by Thee redeemed,\n
Sing we here with glad accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy Lord!\n\n
Holy, holy, holy! All\n
Heaven’s triumphant choirs shall sing\n
When the ransomed nations fall\n
At the footstool of their King:\n
Then shall saints and seraphim,\n
Hearts and voices, swell one hymn,\n
Round the throne with full accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy Lord!\n

6. My God, how wonderful Thou art,\n
Thy majesty, how bright;\n
How beautiful Thy mercy seat,\n
In depths of burning light!\n
How dread are Thy eternal years,\n
O everlasting Lord;\n
By prostrate spirits day and night,\n
Incessantly adored!\n\n
How wonderful, how beautiful,\n
The sight of Thee must be;\n
Thy endless wisdom, boundless power,\n
And glorious purity!\n
O how I fear Thee, living God,\n
With deep and tender fear;\n
And worship Thee with trembling hope,\n
And penitential tears!n\n
No earthly father loves like Thee,\n
No mother, e’er so mild,\n
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done,\n
With me, Thy sinful child.\n
Father of Jesus, love’s reward!\n
What rapture it will be\n
Prostrate before Thy throne to be,\n
And gaze, and gaze on Thee!\n

7. There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,\n
Like the wideness of the sea;\n
There’s a kindness in His justice,\n
Which is more than liberty.\n\n
There is no place where earth’s sorrows\n
Are more felt than up in heaven;\n
There is no place where earth’s failings\n
Have such kindly judgment given.\n\n
There is welcome for the sinner,\n
And more graces for the good;\n
There is mercy with the Saviour;\n
There is healing in His blood.\n\n
There is plentiful redemption\n
In the blood that has been shed;\n
There is joy for all the members\n
In the sorrows of the head.\n\n
For the love of God is broader\n
Than the measure of our mind;\n
And the heart of the Eternal\n
Is most wonderfully kind.\n

8. The love of God is greater far,\n
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;\n
It goes beyond the highest star,\n
And reaches to the lowest hell;\n
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,\n
God gave His Son to win;\n
His erring child He reconciled,\n
And pardoned from his sin.\n\n
Chorus:\n
O love of God, how rich and pure!\n
How measureless and strong!\n
It shall forevermore endure\n
The saints’ and angels’ song.\n\n
When years of time shall pass away,\n
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;\n
When men, who here refuse to pray,\n
On rocks and hills and mountains call;\n
God’s love so sure, shall still endure,\n
All measureless and strong;\n
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race\n
The saints’ and angels’ song.\n\n
Could we with ink the ocean fill,\n
And were the skies of parchment made,\n
Were every stalk on earth a quill,\n
And every man a scribe by trade,\n
To write the love of God above,\n
Would drain the ocean dry.\n
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,\n
Though stretched from sky to sky.\n

9. O God, Thy power is wonderful,\n
Thy glory passing bright;\n
Thy wisdom, with its deep on deep,\n
A rapture to the sight.\n\n
Angelic spirits, countless souls,\n
Of Thee have drunk their fill;\n
And to eternity will drink\n
Thy joy and glory still\n\n
I see Thee in the eternal years\n
In glory all alone,\n
Ere round Thine uncreated fires\n
Created light had shone.\n\n
I see Thee walk in Eden’s shade,\n
I see Thee all through time;\n
Thy patience and compassion seem\n
New attributes sublime.\n\n
I see Thee when the doom is o’er,\n
And outworn time is done,\n
Still, still incomprehensible,\n
O God, yet not alone.\n

10. Far above all is our Saviour enthroned;\n
Crowned is the Lamb, who for sinners atoned,\n
Living for ever to answer our call,\n
God hath exalted Him far above all.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Far above all! Far above all!\n
‘Jesus the crucified’ far above all!\n
Low at His footstool adoring we fall,\n
God hath exalted Him far above all!\n\n
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,\n
Far above all while the ages shall roll,\n
With Him the victors, who followed His call,\n
Share in His royalty far above all.\n

11. I’ve found a friend in Jesus,\n
He’s everything to me,\n
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;\n
The Lily of the valley, in Him alone I see\n
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole;\n
In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay,\n
He tells me every care on Him to roll.\n
He’s the Lily of the valley, the Bright and Morning Star,\n
He’s the Fairest of Ten Thousand to my soul.\n\n
Chorus:\n
In sorrow He’s my comfort, in trouble He’s my stay,\n
He tells me every care on Him to roll.\n
He’s the Lily of the valley, the bright and Morning Star,\n
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.\n\n
He all my grief has taken, and all my sorrows borne,\n
In temptation He’s my strong and mighty tower;\n
I’ve all for Him forsaken; I’ve all my idols torn\n
From my heart, and now He keeps me by his power.\n
Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,\n
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal;\n
He’s the Lily of the valley, the bright and Morning Star,\n
He’s the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.\n

12. Both Lord and Christ hath He been made\n
Whom God raised up, no more to die;\n
With glory crowned, with power arrayed,\n
At God’s right hand exalted high!\n
Him would we own with one accord\n
The Living One-our Sovereign Lord.\n\n
Enriched in Christ with wealth unknown,\n
In whom resources vast are stored;\n
Empowered by Him who fills the throne,\n
Who forth the promised Spirit poured,\n
Through Him we would, with one accord,\n
Both serve, and witness for the Lord.\n\n
Enlightened now in heart, we know\n
God’s great desire, that we should be\n
His dwelling-place on earth below\n
Together built in unity,\n
For Him, to form with one accord,\n
A holy temple in the Lord.\n\n
Encompassed by the peace of God,\n
The things above our hearts engage:\n
With vision fixed on Him who trod\n
The path of all our pilgrimage,\n
We onward move, with one accord,\n
To be for ever with the Lord.\n

13. From heaven He came\n
Into this scene of shame,\n
Thy will to do, Thy claims to own,\n
Thy law fulfil, Thyself make known;\n
From heaven He came.\n\n
To heaven He’s gone;\n
The throne He sits upon.\n
Death He annulled. His vict’ry won,\n
His work complete-Triumphant One!\n
To heaven He’s gone.\n\n
In heaven He dwells;\n
He all our fear dispels;\n
As Great High Priest appearing there,\n
As Lord and Christ for us to care\n
In heaven He dwells.\n\n
From heaven He’ll come\n
To take His people home.\n
He came; He’s gone;\n
He dwells above;\n
And soon for us in wondrous love\n
From heaven He’ll come.\n

14. O Blessed God, to Thee we raise\n
The fruit of lips in priestly praise\n
Of Him who bows our hearts as one\n
Thy holy, holy, holy Son.\n\n
Thy holy Son in lowly guise,\n
Supremely precious in Thine eyes,\n
Most fair to Thee apparelled thus,\n
And fair to us, most fair to us:\n\n
Thy holy Son in manhood true,\n
Thy heart to please, Thy will to do,\n 
Thy name on earth to glorify,\n
For this to live, for this to die:\n\n
Thy holy Son descending low\n
Thy love to tell, Thy heart to show,\n
The full expression of Thy mind,\n
In grace so kind, so wondrous kind.\n\n
Thy holy Son in human form,\n
Baring His bosom to the storm\n
In patient grace for men undone,\n 
Thy holy, holy, holy Son.\n

15. The Lord of glory, being found\n
In fashion as a Man,\n
With moral glory fitly crowned,\n
His path on earth began.\n\n
The form of God to Him pertained:\n
Complete equality\n
Was not an object to be gained,\n
For very God was He.\n\n
Not to His own things did he look,\n
But, in amazing grace,\n
Gave up Himself, and stooping, took\n
The servant’s form and place.\n\n
Self-humbled One whose preciousness\n
Was told in every breath,\n
He served in full devotedness,\n
Obedient unto death.\n\n
In Him the Father found delight,\n
All inexpressible,\n
Radiance of moral glory bright,\n
Fragrance ineffable.\n

16. I know of a name, a beautiful name,\n
An angel brought down to earth;\n
He whispered it low, one night long ago,\n
To a maiden of lowly birth.\n\n
Chorus:\n
That beautiful name, that beautiful name,\n
From sin has power to free us!\n
That beautiful name, that wonderful name,\n
That matchless name is Jesus!\n\n
I know of a name, a beautiful name,\n
That unto a babe was given.\n
The stars glittered bright throughout that glad night,\n
And angels praised God in Heav’n.\n\n
The One of that name, my Saviour became,\n
My Saviour of Calvary.\n
My sins nailed Him there; my burdens He bare.\n
He suffered all this for me.\n\n
I love that blest name, that wonderful name,\n
Made higher than all in heaven.\n
’Twas whispered, I know, in my heart long ago\n
To Jesus my life I’ve giv’n.\n

17. O how sweet the glorious message\n
Simple faith may claim\n
Yesterday, today, forever\n 
Jesus is the same.\n
Still He loves to save the sinful,\n 
Heal the sick and lame\n
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest,\n 
Glory to His name.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Yesterday, today, forever,\n 
Jesus is the same.\n
All may change, but Jesus never!\n 
Glory to His name!\n
Glory to His name! Glory to His name!\n
All may change, but Jesus never!\n 
Glory to His name!\n\n
Oft on earth He healed the sufferer\n 
By His mighty hand\n
Still our sicknesses and our sorrows\n 
Go at His command\n
He who gave His healing virtue\n
To a woman’s touch\n
To the faith that claims His fullness\n 
Still will give as much.\n\n
As of old He walked to Emmaus,\n 
With them to abide\n
So through all life’s way He walketh\n
Ever near our side\n
Soon again we shall behold Him;\n 
Hasten Lord the day\n
But ’twill still be this same Jesus\n 
As He went away.\n

18. Jesus! The name high over all,\n
In hell or earth or sky;\n
Angels and men before it fall,\n
And devils fear and fly.\n\n
Jesus! The name to sinners dear,\n
The name to sinners giv’n;\n
It scatters all their guilty fear,\n
It turns their hell to heav’n.\n\n
Jesus! The prisoner’s fetters breaks,\n
And bruises Satan’s head;\n
Power into strengthless souls it speaks,\n
And life into the dead.\n\n
His only righteousness I show,\n
His saving grace proclaim;\n
’Tis all my business here below\n
To cry ‘Behold the Lamb!’\n\n
Happy, if with my latest breath\n
I may but gasp His name,\n
Preach Him to all and cry in death,\n
‘Behold, behold the Lamb!’\n

19. His name is Wonderful,\n 
His name is Wonderful,\n

His name is ‘Bread of Life’, to satisfy\n
His name is healing, for every nation\n
His name is Jesus, His name is Lord.\n

And set the captive free\n

That I have ever known.\n

To reconcile man to God.\n

To every believer the promise of God;\n

That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.\n\n

And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;\n
But purer, and higher, and greater will be\n
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.\n

In the presence of Jesus, and sings this new song:\n\n

Unto Him be the glory forever, Amen.\n\n
All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight,\n
Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite:\n\n

He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing:\n\n
Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,\n
So that others believing, this new song shall sing:\n

Filled with the fullness of our God,\n
Walking by faith the path He trod,\n
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\n\n
Leaning our heads on Jesus’ breast,\n
Knowing the joy of that sweet rest,\n
Finding in Him the chief, the best,\n
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!\n\n
Kept by His power from day to day,\n
Held by His hand, we cannot stray,\n

Living in us His own pure life,\n
Giving us rest from inward strife,\n
From strength to strength, from death to life,\n

The wonderful Saviour of men,\n
Who suffered and died for the sinner\n

Oh wonderful, wonderful story,\n
The dearest that ever was told\n
I’ll repeat it in glory, the wonderful story\n
Where I shall His beauty behold\n\n
He came from the brightest of glory;\n
His blood as a ransom He gave,\n
To purchase eternal redemption,\n
And oh, He is mighty to save!\n\n

His love is unmeasured and free;\n
His grace is for ever sufficient,\n
It reaches and purifies me.\n

Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;\n

Oh, it is wonderful that He should care for me!\n
Enough to die for me!\n
Oh, it is wonderful, wonderful to me!\n\n
I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine,\n
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;\n
That He should extend His great love unto such as I;\n
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.\n\n
I think of His hands pierced and bleeding to pay the debt!\n
Such mercy, such love, and devotion can I forget?\n
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,\n
Until at the glorified throne I kneel at His feet.\n

52. When none was found to ransom me, He was found worthy.\n
To set a world of sinners free, He was found worthy.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, the bleeding Lamb!\n
He was found worthy.\n\n
To take the book and loose the seal, He was found worthy.\n
To bruise the head that bruised His heel, He was found worthy.\n\n
To bridge the gulf ’twix man and God, He was found worthy.\n
And save the rebels by His blood, He was found worthy.\n\n
To open wide the gates of heaven, He was found worthy.\n
To Him all majesty be given!  He was found worthy.\n\n
To reign o’er all the ransomed race, He was found worthy.\n
I’ve tasted of His saving grace, He was found worthy.\n

53. Christ is merciful and mild;\n
He was once a little child;\n
He whom heavenly hosts adore\n 
Lived on earth among the poor.\n\n
Thus He veiled His glory by\n
When for us He stooped to die;\n
How I wonder when I see\n
His unbounded love to me!\n\n
He the sick to health restored,\n
To the poor He preached the word;\n
Even children had a share\n
Of His love and tender care.\n\n
Every bird can build its nest,\n
Foxes have their place of rest;\n
He by whom the world was made\n
Had not where to lay His head.\n\n
He who is the Lord most high\n
Then was poorer far than I,\n
That, I might hereafter be\n
Rich to all eternity.\n

54. To thee and to thy Christ, O God,\n
We sing, we ever sing;\n
For He the lonely wine press trod,\n
Our cup of joy to bring.\n
His glorious arm the strife maintained,\n
He marched in might from far;\n
His robes were with the vintage stained,\n
Red with the wine of war.\n\n
To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God,\n
We sing, we ever sing;\n
For He invaded death’s abode,\n
And robbed it of its sting.\n
The house of dust enthralls no more,\n
For He, the strong to save,\n
Himself doth guard that silent door,\n
Great keeper of the grave.\n\n
To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God,\n
We sing, we ever sing;\n
For He hath crushed beneath His rod\n
The world’s proud rebel king.\n
He plunged in His imperial strength\n
To gulfs of darkness down;\n
He brought His trophy up at length,\n
The foiled usurper’s crown.\n\n
To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God,\n
We sing, we ever sing;\n
For He redeemed us with His blood\n
From every evil thing.\n
Thy saving strength His arm upbore,\n
The arm that set us free:\n
Glory, O God, forevermore\n
Be to Thy Christ and Thee.\n

55. A wealth of grace and truth replete\n
Enriched the path those holy feet\n
With steadfast purpose trod.\n
Each faultless step, with fragrance fraught,\n 
Fresh grace revealed and pleasure brought\n
To Thee, His Father, God.\n\n
The wilderness, the mountain-side,\n 
The wayside well, the stormy tide,\n
Served to reveal the worth\n
Of Him who had not where to lay\n
His head on earth, as day by day,\n
He told His Father forth.\n\n
All Satan’s wiles, all human power,\n
United in that dreadful hour\n
Of shame, which He foreknew,\n
Could not impede Him as He passed\n
In grace to reach the Cross at last\n
His Father’s will to do.\n\n
Well may our souls in worship bow\n
To Thee, His God and Father, now,\n
And offer Thee our praise\n
While musing on Thine Only Son,\n
The altogether lovely One,\n
In all His matchless ways.\n

56. As prophets past foretold Him,\n 
Anointed eyes behold Him.\n
Together gathered to Him,\n
His God we worship through Him,\n
Remembering, remembering,\n
Our Blessed Lord remembering.\n\n
His going forth, obeying,\n
From that dark place of praying,\n
The cup of sorrow taking,\n
To taste that dread forsaking!\n
Remembering, remembering;\n
Our Blessed Lord remembering!\n\n
His meek, majestic bearing,\n
The mocking purple wearing,\n
In lowliness submitting\n
His face to shame and spitting.\n
Remembering, remembering;\n
Our Blessed Lord remembering!\n\n
His patience, un-opposing,\n
’Mid darkness o’er Him closing,\n
Those unknown pangs enduring,\n
Eternal peace procuring!\n
Remembering, remembering,\n
Our Blessed Lord remembering!\n\n


57. Blessed God, we come before Thee,\n
And with holy rev’rence bow,\n
While in worship we adore Thee\n
As His God and Father now;\n
Musing on Thy Son today\n
In Thine Own appointed way.\n\n
We remember Him as being\n
Found on earth in manhood true,\n
How He said, His path foreseeing,\n
‘Lo, I come, Thy will to do.’\n
Man of single purpose, He\n
This accomplished perfectly.\n\n
In that holy body dwelling,\n
Which for Him Thou didst prepare,\n
Unto men Thy heart forthtelling,\n
For thine interests He would care,\n
Drawing, binding to Him still,\n
Those who do the Father’s will!\n\n
Such a steadfast path reviewing,\n
Filled throughout with nought but good,\n
Finding ever in the doing\n
Of Thy will and work His food!\n
We His preciousness proclaim,\n
Making mention of His name.\n

58. Blessed God, we meditate\n
On thy Son in low estate,\n
Glory seeking not, nor fame,\n
Moving to a cross of shame.\n\n
Perfect Man to thee, his God,\n
Beautiful the path He trod!\n
His delight to do Thy will,\n
And the Scriptures to fulfil!\n\n
Pleasing not Himself on earth, \n
Manifesting rarest worth,\n
Ever doing nought but good,\n
All Thy will His pleasant food!\n\n
Clothed with meekness and with might,\n
Turning not to left or right,\n
Thus the One whom Thou did’st send\n
Journeyed onward to the end.\n\n
Thee, O Blessed God, we praise,\n
Meditating on His ways\n
In the perfect path He trod,\n
Glorifying Thee, His God.\n

59. His goings forth of old,\n
From everlasting days,\n
To everlasting will be told\n
In everlasting praise.\n\n
Men marked with wonderment\n
Heaven’s conqueror advance,\n 
Superlatively competent\n
In every circumstance.\n\n
Clothed with humility,\n
There rested on Him still\n
An unadorned Majesty\n
Incomprehensible.\n\n
Superior to scorn,\n
In purple, forth He came\n
To conquer in a crown of thorn\n
Upon a cross of shame.\n\n
His name shall be extolled\n
In everlasting praise,\n
Whose goings forth have been of old,\n
From everlasting days.\n

60. On that same night, Lord Jesus,\n
In which Thou wast betrayed,\n
When without cause man’s hatred\n
Against Thee wast displayed,\n
We hear Thy voice, blest Saviour,\n
‘This do, remember me’:\n
With grateful hearts responding,\n
We would remember Thee.\n\n
We think of all the darkness\n
Which round Thy spirit pressed\n
Of all those waves and billows\n
Which rolled across Thy breast;\n
’Tis there Thy grace unbounded\n
And perfect love we see;\n
With joy and yet with sorrow\n
We do remember Thee.\n\n
We know Thee now as risen,\n
The firstborn from the dead;\n
We see Thee now ascended,\n
The church’s glorious head:\n
In Thee by grace accepted;\n
With heart and mind set free,\n
We think of all Thy sorrow,\n
And thus remember Thee.\n\n
Till Thou shalt come in glory\n
And call us hence away,\n
To share with Thee the brightness\n
Of that unclouded day,\n
We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,\n
And here would seek to be\n
More to Thy death conformed,\n
Whilst we remember Thee.\n

61. One day when heaven was filled with His praises,\n
One day when sin was as black as could be,\n
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin,\n
Dwelt among men, my example is He!\n\n
Chorus:\n
Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;\n
Buried, He carried my sins far away;\n
Rising, He justified freely forever;\n
One day He’s coming- O glorious day!\n\n
One day they led Him up Calvary’s mountain,\n
One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;\n
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected:\n
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!\n\n
One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,\n
One day the stone rolled away from the door;\n
Then He arose, over death He had conquered;\n
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!\n\n
One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,\n
One day the skies with His glories will shine;\n
Wonderful day, my belovèd ones bringing;\n
Glorious Saviour, this Jesus is mine!\n

62. I will sing the wondrous story\n
Of the Christ who died for me,\n
How He left his home in glory\n
For the cross of Calvary.\n\n
I was lost, but Jesus found me,\n
Found the sheep that went astray,\n
Threw His loving arms around me,\n
Drew me back into His way \n\n
I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;\n
Faint was I from many a fall;\n
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,\n
But He freed me from them all.\n\n
Days of darkness still come o’er me,\n
Sorrow’s paths I often tread,\n
But the Saviour still is with me;\n
By His hand I’m safely led.\n\n
He will keep me till the river\n
Rolls its waters at my feet;\n
Then He’ll bear me safely over,\n
Where the loved ones I shall meet.\n

63. A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord\n
A wonderful Saviour to me;\n
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,\n
Where rivers of pleasure I see.\n\n
Chorus:\n
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,\n
That shadows a dry thirsty land;\n
He hideth my life in the depths of His love,\n
And covers me there with His hand.\n\n
A wonderful Saviour is Jesus, my Lord\n
He taketh my burden away;\n
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be mov’d\n
He giveth me strength as my day.\n\n
With numberless blessings each moment He crowns\n
And filled with His fullness divine,\n
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,\n
For such a Redeemer as mine!\n\n
When clothed in His brightness transported I rise,\n
To meet Him in clouds of the sky\n
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,\n
I’ll shout with the millions on high.\n

64. King of my life, I crown Thee now,\n
Thine shall the glory be.\n
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow\n
Lead me to Calvary.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Lest I forget Gethsemane,\n
Lest I forget Thine agony,\n
Lest I forget Thy love for me,\n
Lead me to Calvary.\n\n
Let me like Mary, through the gloom,\n
Come with a gift to Thee.\n
Show to me now the empty tomb,\n
Lead me to Calvary.\n\n
May I be willing, Lord to bear,\n
Daily my cross for Thee.\n
Even Thy cup of grief to share,\n
Thou hast borne all for me.\n

65. Who is this that cometh from Edom,\n
Crimson red His garments dyed,\n
In His hands are cruel nail-prints,\n
And a spear-wound in His side?\n
Say, who is this ‘Man of Sorrows?’\n
Why is He thus pierced and scarred?\n
Why with face and form so kingly\n
Why His beauteous visage marred?\n\n
Chorus:\n
It is Christ, the King of glory,\n
Who His life a ransom gave\n
Bow before Him, and adore Him,\n
Jesus Christ the mighty to save\n\n
Who is this, despised and rejected,\n
Who the wine-press trod alone?\n
Who is this by all forsaken,\n
Left to comfort there are none?\n
Who is this oppressed, afflicted,\n
Yet no murmur ever heard;\n
As a Lamb led to the slaughter,\n
Yet He answers not a word!\n\n
Who is this with bearing so kingly,\n
And a crown His brow adorns,\n
Not of gold and gems befitting,\n
But of mocking, cruel thorns?\n
Why with many stripes thus beaten?\n
Why thus scourged and spit upon?\n
Why His anguish in the garden,\n
Kneeling, praying all alone.\n\n
Who is this on Calvary’s mountain,\n
Dying there such shameful death?\n
Who for His tormentors praying\n
With His last expiring breath?\n
Who is this that earth should tremble\n
And the sun in darkness hide,\n
Rocks be rent and graves be opened,\n
When He bowed his head and died?\n

66. Glory be to Jesus,\n
Who in bitter pains\n 
Poured for me the life-blood\n
From His sacred veins!\n\n
Grace and life eternal\n
In that blood I find;\n
Blest be His compassion,\n
Infinitely kind!\n\n
Abel’s blood for vengeance\n
Pleaded to the skies;\n
But the blood of Jesus\n
For our pardon cries!\n\n
Oft as earth exulting\n
Wafts its praise on high,\n 
Angel-hosts rejoicing\n
Make their glad reply.\n\n 
Blest through endless ages\n
Be the precious stream,\n
Which from endless torments\n
Did the world redeem.\n

67. ’Tis midnight: and on Olive’s brow\n
The star is dimmed that lately shone;\n
’Tis midnight; in the garden now\n
The suffering Saviour prays alone.\n\n
’Tis midnight: and from all removed,\n
The Saviour wrestles ’lone a fears;\n
E’en that disciple whom He loved\n
Heeds not his Master’s grief and tears.\n\n
’Tis midnight: and for others’ guilt\n
The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;\n 
Yet he, who hath in anguish knelt,\n
Is not forsaken by his God.\n\n
’Tis midnight: and from ether-plains\n
Is borne the song that angels know;\n
Unheard by mortals are the strains\n
That sweetly soothe the Saviour’s woe.\n

68. Behold the man by God approved\n
As with a steadfast face He moved\n
Toward Jerusalem to die,\n
His Father God to glorify.\n\n
His perfect love expressed we see,\n
To those who, in their enmity,\n
His kindness and His grace ignored;\n
And in return their rage outpoured.\n\n
O wondrous sight that meets our gaze\n
The Son of God, in sore amaze,\n
Lies prostrate in Gethsemane\n
And weeps and prays in agony!\n\n
Submissive to His Father’s will,\n
He shows His deep devotion still\n
In yonder judgment hall displayed,\n
Thorn crowned and purple robe arrayed.\n\n
God’s Holy One upon the tree\n
Laid down His life triumphantly;\n
The depth of sorrow there entailed\n
His full perfection has unveiled.\n\n
And thus with hearts that overflow,\n
Although we cannot fully know\n
His preciousness, for Him we raise\n
To thee, O God, our hymn of praise.\n

69. Darkness veiled Gethsemane\n
While He prayed in agony;\n
Sore amazed, His sweat like blood,\n
Cries and tears poured forth in flood!\n
His th’exceeding sorrow there,\n
His the cup that none might share.\n\n
Undesired, betrayed and bound,\n
Wicked men beset Him round;\n
Spat on, scourged, and mocked in scorn,\n
Robed in purple, wreathed with thorn!\n
’Mid such base indignity,\n
Matchless his tranquillity.\n\n
There, upon the tree, He passed\n
Into sorrow’s depths at last.\n
He alone, so spotless pure,\n
Could such anguish sore endure,\n
Would in love devoted, free,\n
Unto death obedient be.\n\n
Fadeless scenes thus pond’ring o’er,\n
Our adoring worship pour\n 
Unto Thee, O God, today,\n
For Thy Son in this Thy way;\n 
All His life and death review,\n 
And His praises sing anew.\n

70. O God, can we Thy Son forget,\n
Forget His agony,\n
Forget His tears and blood-like sweat\n
In dark Gethsemane?\n\n
Can we forget Him seized and led,\n
Forsaken by His own,\n
When all His friends afar had fled\n
And left Him all alone?\n\n
Forget that base indignity\n
Within the judgment hall,\n 
Forget Him led, in mockery,\n
Without the city wall?\n\n
Forget those pierced hands and feet,\n
That thorn-crowned head bowed low,\n 
Forget that sacrifice most sweet\n
Upon that cross of woe?\n\n
Forget Him? Nay! We love to dwell\n
In this remembrance meet\n
Upon the One who pleased Thee well\n
And on His work complete.\n

71. I hear the Saviour say,\n
‘Thy strength indeed is small;\n
Come to me – I’ll be thy stay,\n
Find in me thine all in all.’\n\n
Chorus:\n
Jesus paid it all,\n
All to Him I owe.\n
Sin had left a crimson stain,\n
He washed it white as snow.\n\n
For nothing good have I\n
Whereby Thy grace to claim;\n
Jesus died my soul to save,\n
And blessed be His name.\n\n
And when before the throne,\n
I stand, in Him complete:\n
‘Jesus died my soul to save,’\n
My lips shall still repeat.\n

72. They nailed my Lord upon the tree,\n
And left Him, dying, there;\n
Through love He suffered there for me,\n
’Twas love beyond compare.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Crucified! Crucified!\n
And nailed upon the tree!\n
With pierced hands and feet and side!\n
For you! For me!\n\n
Upon His head a crown of thorns,\n
Upon His heart my shame;\n
For me He prayed, for me He died,\n
And, dying, spoke my name.\n\n
‘Forgive them, O forgive!’ He cried,\n
Then bowed His sacred head;\n
O Lamb of God! My sacrifice!\n
For me Thy blood was shed.\n\n
His voice I hear, His love I know;\n
I worship at His feet;\n
And kneeling there, at Calvary’s Cross,\n
Redemption is complete.\n

73. Alas! And did my Saviour bleed,\n
And did my Sovereign die?\n
Would He devote that sacred head,\n
For such a worm as I?\n\n
Chorus:\n
At the cross, at the cross\n 
Where I first saw the light,\n
And the burden of my heart rolled away,\n
It was there by faith I received my sight,\n
And now I am happy all the day!\n\n
Was it for crimes that I had done\n
He groaned upon the tree?\n
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!\n
And love beyond degree!\n\n
Well might the sun in darkness hide\n
And shut His glories in,\n
When Christ, the mighty maker died,\n
For man the creature’s sin.\n\n
Thus might I hide my blushing face\n
While His dear cross appears,\n
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,\n
And melt my eyes to tears.\n

74. It pleased the Lord to bruise His only Son,\n
On Calvary,\n
That He might ransom sinners such as you,\n
And set you free.\n
He hid His face from Jesus, whom He lov’d,\n
So tenderly,\n
With all His heart in yearnings deep and true,\n
On Calvary.\n\n
Although the piercing wail went up on high,\n
From Calvary,\n
‘My God, oh, why hast Thou forsaken me,\n
On Calvary.’\n
The heav’ns returned no echo, groan nor sigh,\n
On that dark day,\n
And all that He might freely pardon me,\n
On Calvary.\n\n
The Cross unfolds the wondrous love divine,\n
On Calvary,\n
And shows in woe love’s majesty supreme,\n
On Calvary.\n
Then yield to Him that burden’d heart of thine\n
At Calvary,\n
And then the Cross will be thy theme throughout\n
Eternity.\n

75. From the Bethlehem manger-home,\n
Walking His dear form beside,\n
We to Calvary’s mount have come,\n
Where our Lord was crucified.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Sweet tones of love come down the ages through:\n
‘Father, forgive! They know not what they do.’\n\n
Scornful words the soldiers fling,\n
Wicked rulers Him deride, Saying,\n
‘If Thou be the King, save Thyself,\n
Thou crucified!’\n\n
Wondrous love for sinful men,\n
Of the sinless One that died!\n
May we wound Thee not again,\n
Thou, O Christ, the Crucified!\n

76. On Calvary’s brow, my Saviour died,\n
’Twas there my Lord was crucified:\n
’Twas on the cross He bled for me,\n
And purchased there my pardon free.\n\n
Chorus:\n
O Calvary! Dark Calvary!\n
Where Jesus shed His blood for me:\n
O Calvary! Blest Calvary!\n
’Twas there my Saviour died for me.\n\n
’Mid rending rocks and darkening skies,\n
My Saviour bows His head and dies;\n
The opening vail reveals the way.\n
To heaven’s joys and endless day.\n\n
O Jesus, Lord, how can it be,\n
That Thou shouldst give Thy life for me?\n
To bear the cross and agony,\n
In that dread hour on Calvary!\n

77. High on a cruel cross of shame,\n
’Mid mockery and scorn,\n
Nailed with His superscribed name,\n
Wearing a crown of thorn!\n\n
Friend of the friendless and the sad,\n
Who wept o’er others’ woes,\n
Left by the failing friends He had,\n
Friendless among His foes!\n\n
Giver to all of life, and breath,\n
And riches that endure,\n
Ranked with the robbers in His death,\n
Poorest among the poor!\n\n
Mocked by the mob that round Him stands\n
To view their work complete\n
Nails through His holy, healing -hands,\n
And through His holy feet!\n\n
Pouring appreciative praise\n
From hearts His worth has won\n
To Thee, His God, our hymn we raise,\n
Remembering Thy Son.\n

78. In holy majesty He moved\n
Towards a cross of shame;\n
And every step the fuller proved\n
The glory of His name.\n\n
Not even Messianic birth\n
His honour could enhance;\n
The bogus dignity of earth\n
Was withered in His glance.\n\n
Before the earth on which He trod\n
Its circuit had begun,\n
Forever was He Son of God,\n
Forever God the Son.\n\n
Unqualified perfection sealed\n
The witness of His Word;\n
And every touch afresh revealed\n
None other than the Lord.\n\n
And yet, O lowliness most high!\n
For this to earth He came,\n
As man for guilty men to die\n
Upon a cross of shame.\n

79. Nailed to a Cross! Those holy hands\n
That healed the helpless in their pain,\n
That loosed with tender touch their bands\n
And brought them life again!\n\n
Those holy hands that broke the bread\n
When, in His kindness and His care,\n
The fainting multitude He fed\n
In yonder desert bare!\n\n
Nailed to a Cross! those holy feet\n
That trod that lowly, lovely way,\n
Each step a wealth of fragrance sweet,\n
Sweet for eternity!\n\n
Those holy feet that never strayed\n
Nor stumbled in the path, but trod,\n
Unfaltering and unafraid,\n
On in the will of God!\n\n
Nailed to a Cross! The Prince of Life!\n
The Lord of Glory’s dying place!\n
A cross that leaves a world of strife\n
Forever in disgrace!\n

80. ‘The hour’ arrives; they reach ‘the place’,\n
The cross they raise on high,\n
The Lord of glory and of grace\n
They leave to die.\n\n
With holy awe we call to mind\n
That solemn scene of woe,\n
The depth to which, in love so kind,\n
He there would go.\n\n
And His the pain, the bitter smart,\n
The ignominious place,\n
The parched lips, the melted heart,\n
The marred face.\n\n
There His perfection would we view,\n
Displayed in such a death\n
Devoted, meet, submissive, true\n
To His last breath!\n\n
So for Himself we offer now\n
Our worship, God, to Thee,\n
In glad response our hearts we bow\n
Adoringly.\n

81. What a wonderful, wonderful Saviour,\n
Who would die on the cross for me!\n
Freely shedding His precious lifeblood,\n
That the sinner might be made free.\n\n
Chorus:\n
He was nailed to the cross for me,\n
He was nailed to the cross for me;\n
On the cross crucified for me He died;\n
He was nailed to the cross for me.\n\n
Thus He veiled His heavenly glory,\n
To accomplish His Father’s plan;\n
He was born of a virgin Mary,\n
Took upon Him the form of man.\n\n
He was wounded for our transgressions,\n
And He carried our sorrows, too;\n
He’s the healer of ev’ry sickness,\n
This He came to the world to do.\n\n
So He gave His life for others\n
In redeeming this world from sin,\n
And He’s gone to prepare a mansion,\n
That at last we may enter in.\n

82. Love sent my Saviour to die in my stead,\n
Why did He love me so?\n
Meekly to Calvary’s cross He was led\n
Why did He love me so?\n\n
Chorus:\n
Why did He love me so?\n 
Why did He love me so?\n
Why did my Saviour to Calvary go?\n
Why did He love me so?\n\n
Nails pierced His hands and His feet for my sin,\n
Why did He love me so?\n
He suffered sore my salvation to win\n
Why did He love me so?\n\n
O how He agonized there in my place\n
Why did He love me so?\n
Nothing withholding my sin to efface\n
Why did He love me so?\n

83. Nothing either great or small\n
Nothing, sinner, no;\n
Jesus did it, did it all,\n
Long, long ago.\n\n
Chorus:\n
‘It is finished!’ Yes, indeed\n
Finished, every jot:\n
Sinner, this is all you need\n
Tell me, is it not?\n\n
When He, from his lofty throne\n
Stooped to do and die,\n
Everything was fully done:\n
Hearken to His cry.\n\n
Till to Jesus’ work you cling\n
By a simple faith,\n
‘Doing’ is a deadly thing\n
‘Doing’ ends in death.\n\n
Weary, working, burdened on\n
Wherefore toil you so?\n
Cease your doing: all was done\n
Long, long ago.\n

84. Far dearer than all that the world can impart\n
Was the message that came to my heart\n
How that Jesus alone for my sin did atone,\n
And Calvary covers it all.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Calvary covers it all,\n
My past with its sin and stain;\n
My guilt and despair Jesus took on Him there\n
And Calvary covers it all.\n\n
The stripes that He bore and the thorns that He wore\n
Told His mercy and love ever more;\n
And my heart bowed in shame as I called on His name\n
And Calvary covers it all.\n\n
How matchless the grace, when I looked in the face\n
Of this Jesus, my crucified Lord;\n
My redemption complete I then found at His feet\n
And Calvary covers it all.\n\n
How blessed the thought, that my soul by Him bought,\n
Shall be His in the glory on high;\n
Where the gladness and song I’ll be one of the throng\n
And Calvary covers it all.\n

85. How deep the Father’s love for us,\n 
How vast beyond all measure\n
That He should give His only Son,\n 
To make a wretch His treasure\n
How great the pain of searing loss,\n 
The Father turned His face away\n
As wounds, which mar the chosen One,\n 
Bring many sons to glory\n\n
Behold the man upon a cross,\n 
My sin upon His shoulders\n
Ashamed, I hear my mocking voice\n 
Call out among the scoffers\n
It was my sin that held Him there\n
Until it was accomplished\n
His dying breath has brought me life;\n 
I know that it is finished\n\n
I will not boast in anything:\n 
No gifts, no power, no wisdom\n
But I will boast in Jesus Christ;\n 
His death and resurrection\n
Why should I gain from His reward?\n 
I cannot give an answer\n
But this I know with all my heart:\n 
His death has paid my ransom\n

86. Above all powers, above all kings,\n
Above all nature, and all created things,\n
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man,\n
You were here before the world began.\n\n
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones,\n
Above all wonders the world has ever known,\n
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth,\n
There’s no way to measure what you’re worth\n\n
Crucified! Laid behind a stone,\n
You lived to die, rejected and alone,\n
Like a rose trampled on the ground,\n
You took the fall and thought of me.\n
Above all.\n

87. Here is love vast as the ocean,\n
Loving kindness as the flood\n
When the prince of life: our ransom,\n
Shed for us His precious blood!\n
Who, His love will not remember?\n
Who can cease to sing His praise?\n
He can never be forgotten,\n
Throughout heaven’s eternal days.\n\n
On the mount of crucifixion,\n
Fountains opened deep and wide.\n
Through the floodgates of God’s mercy,\n
Flowed a vast and glorious tide.\n
Grace and love, like mighty rivers,\n
Poured incessant from above.\n
Heaven’s peace and perfect justice,\n
Kissed the guilty world in love.\n

88. All people that on earth do dwell,\n
Sing to the Lord with cheerful voice.\n
Him serve with fear, His praise forth tell;\n
Come ye before Him and rejoice.\n\n
The Lord, ye know, is God indeed;\n
Without our aid He did us make;\n
We are His folk, He doth us feed,\n
And for His sheep He doth us take.\n\n
O enter then His gates with praise;\n
Approach with joy His courts unto;\n
Praise, laud, and bless His name always,\n
For it is seemly so to do.\n\n
For why? The Lord our God is good;\n
His mercy is for ever sure;\n
His truth at all times firmly stood,\n
And shall from age to age endure.\n\n
To Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,\n
The God whom heaven and earth adore,\n
From men and from the angel host\n
Be praise and glory evermore.\n

89. Oh, bliss of the purified! Bliss of the free,\n
I plunge in the crimson tide opened for me;\n
O’er sin and uncleanness exulting I stand,\n
And point to the print of the nails in His hand.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, sing of His mighty love,\n
Sing of His mighty love,\n
Sing of His mighty love,\n
Mighty to save.\n\n
Oh, bliss of the purified! Jesus is mine,\n
No longer in dread condemnation I pine;\n
In conscious salvation I sing of His grace,\n
Who lifted upon me the light of His face.\n\n
Oh, bliss of the purified! Bliss of the pure!\n
No wound hath the soul that His blood cannot cure;\n
No sorrow-bowed head but may sweetly find rest,\n
No tears - but may dry them on Jesus’ breast.\n\n
O Jesus the Crucified! Thee will I sing,\n
My blessèd Redeemer, my God, and my King;\n
My soul, filled with rapture, shall shout o’er the grave,\n
And triumph in death in the ‘Mighty to Save.’\n

90. Precious Saviour, Thou hast saved me,\n
Thine, and only Thine I am;\n
Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!\n
Glory, glory to the Lamb!\n\n
Chorus:\n
Glory, glory, hallelujah!\n
Glory, glory to the Lamb!\n
Oh the cleansing blood has reached me!\n
Glory, glory to the Lamb!\n\n
Long my yearning heart was striving,\n
To obtain this precious rest;\n
But when all my struggles ended,\n
Simply trusting, I was blest.\n\n
Glory to the Lord who bought me!\n
Glory for His saving power!\n
Glory to the Lord who keeps me!\n
Glory, glory, evermore!\n

91.Behold the precious Lamb of God,\n
Who died upon the tree,\n
That guilty sinners, such as I,\n
Might thro’ His grace be free.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Thy boundless love I’ll sing,\n
Thy grace O full and free,\n
’Tis under Thy protecting wing,\n
My soul delights to be!\n\n
Behold the healing streams of grace,\n
That from His side did flow,\n
I plunged beneath the crimson flood,\n
That washes white as snow.\n\n
Behold the Cross He bore for me,\n
Whereby He saved my soul,\n
His matchless grace shall be my theme,\n
While countless ages roll.\n\n

92. Oh, bless the Lord, He cleansed my soul,\n
And filled my lips with singing;\n
He came in my poor, sinful heart,\n
And set the joybells ringing.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, praise the Lord, He first loved me,\n
I feel life up-springing;\n
He came in my poor, sinful heart,\n
And set the joybells ringing.\n\n
He placed my feet upon the Rock,\n
The only sure foundation;\n
He shows me wonders of His grace,\n
The blessings of salvation.\n\n
His promise is ‘for all the days.’\n
His love for me is caring;\n
While in the ‘Father’s House’ above,\n
A mansion He’s preparing.\n\n
His love is calling, seeking still,\n
Come, ev’ry burden bringing;\n
The touch of Christ within your heart,\n
Will set the joybells ringing.\n\n

93. Praise the Lord with heart and voice,\n
Joyfully serving your King,\n
Come and worship at His throne,\n
Lovingly, gratefully sing;\n
Happy ev’ry hour, trusting in His power,\n
Unto the Giver of our salvation praises bring.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Praise Him I sing with melody, heart and voice.\n
Praise Him everlastingly, come, rejoice;\n
Hail Him, Lord, most glorious, mighty One victorious,\n
Praise His Holy name.\n
Praise Him, heav’nly company, angels bright.\n
Crown Him now and evermore, Lord of light:\n
Praise Him, all creation, God of our salvation,\n
Boundless in majesty, King eternal\n
Praise His name.\n\n
Praise the dear Redeemer’s name,\n
Crown Him with beauty and light,\n
Just and true are all His ways,\n
Wonderful, boundless His might;\n
Glad hosannas swelling, loud His\n
Goodness telling,\n
Fountain of blessing our joy\n
Eternal, day and night.\n\n
Praise the Lord with heart and voice,\n
Ever adoringly raise\n
Hallelujahs sweet and strong,\n
Unto the ‘Ancient of days;’\n
Shout with acclamation, hail Him\n
All creation,\n
Worship Jehovah, O come rejoicing,\n
Sound His praise.\n

94. I love to think of Christ my King\n
Who did salvation freely bring;\n
So while I live I mean to sing,\n
Hallelujah! Grace is free.\n\n
Chorus:\n
O Hallelujah I grace to free,\n
This my song shall ever be;\n
Jesus died to set me free,\n
Hallelujah! Grace is free.\n\n
O wondrous is the crimson flood!\n
O precious is the cleansing blood!\n
My Jesus as my surety stood,\n
Hallelujah! Grace is free.\n\n
What greater love can ever be,\n
To die upon a cruel tree,\n
And ransom such a wretch as me\n
Hallelujah! Grace is free.\n\n
And when I reach that silver strand,\n
And join that holy, happy band,\n
This song I’ll sing in that bright land,\n
Hallelujah! Grace is free.\n

95. My song shall be of Jesus;\n
His mercy crowns my days,\n
He fills my cup with blessings,\n
And tunes my heart to praise.\n\n
My song shall be of Jesus,\n 
The precious Lamb of God,\n
Who gave Himself my ransom,\n
And bought me with His blood.\n\n
My song shall be of Jesus;\n
When, sitting at His feet,\n
I call to mind His goodness,\n
In meditation sweet.\n\n
My song shall be of Jesus,\n
Whatever ill betide;\n
I’ll sing the grace that saves me,\n
And keeps me at His side.\n\n
My song shall be of Jesus,\n
While pressing on my way\n
To reach the blissful region\n 
Of pure and perfect day.\n

96. Come, let us sing of Jesus,\n
While hearts and accents blend;\n
Come, let us sing of Jesus,\n
The sinner’s only Friend.\n
His holy soul rejoices,\n
Amid the choirs above,\n
To hear our youthful voices\n
Exulting in His love.\n\n
We love to sing of Jesus,\n
Who died our souls to save;\n
We love to sing of Jesus,\n
Triumphant o’er the grave;\n
And in our hour of danger\n
We’ll trust His love alone,\n
Who once slept in a manger,\n
And now sits on the throne.\n\n
Then let us sing of Jesus\n
While yet on earth we stay,\n
And hope to sing of Jesus\n
Throughout the eternal day.\n
For those who here confess Him\n
He will in heaven confess;\n
And faithful hearts that bless Him\n
He will for ever bless.\n

97. Give me a sight, O Saviour,\n
Of Thy wondrous love to me,\n
Of the love that brought Thee down to earth,\n
To die on Calvary.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, make me understand it,\n
Help me to take it in,\n
What it meant to Thee, the Holy One,\n
To bear away my sin.\n\n
Was it the nails, O Saviour,\n
That bound Thee to the tree?\n
Nay, ’twas thine everlasting love,\n
Thy love for me, for me.\n\n
Oh, wonder of all wonders,\n
That through Thy death for me,\n
My open sins, my secret sins,\n
Can all forgiven be!\n\n
Then melt my heart, O Saviour,\n
Bend me, yes, break me down,\n
Until I own Thee Conqueror,\n
And Lord and Sovereign crown.\n

98. Jesus, Thy boundless love to me\n
No thought can reach, no tongue declare;\n
Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,\n
And reign without a rival there!\n
Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;\n
Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.\n\n
Oh, grant that nothing in my soul\n
May dwell, but Thy pure love alone!\n
Oh, may Thy love possess me whole\n
My joy, my treasure, and my crown!\n
All coldness from my heart remove;\n
May every act, word, thought, be love.\n\n
O Love, how cheering is thy ray!\n
All pain before Thy presence flies;\n
Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,\n
Where’er Thy healing beams arise;\n
O Jesus, nothing may I see,\n
Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.\n

99. O Saviour, precious Saviour,\n
Whom, yet unseen, we love;\n
O name of might and favour,\n
All other names above:\n\n

We worship Thee! We bless Thee!\n
To Thee alone we sing!\n
We praise Thee and confess Thee,\n
Our Saviour, Lord, and King!\n\n
O bringer of salvation,\n
Who wondrously hast wrought,\n
Thyself the revelation\n
Of love beyond our thought.\n\n
In Thee all fulness dwelleth,\n
All grace and power divine;\n 
The glory that-excelleth,\n
O Son of God, is Thine!\n\n
Oh, grant the consummation\n
Of this our song, above,\n
In endless adoration,\n
And everlasting love.\n\n

100. Our voice, with one accord,\n
To Thee, His God we raise,\n
While in the midst is He, the Lord,\n
The leader of the praise,\n 
The subject of our song,\n 
Our centre as we sing,\n
Our Lord His gathered ones among,\n
Through whom our praise we bring.\n\n
With every heart as one,\n
As by the Spirit moved,\n
We muse on Thy Beloved Son,\n
The Man by Thee approved.\n
As to the past we turn,\n
And each His path surveys,\n
Our raptured hearts within us burn,\n
Our lips are filled with praise.\n\n
A holy priesthood, near,\n
Through Jesus’ blood, we draw\n
To Thee, His God and Father here\n
With reverence and awe.\n
As if with feet unshod,\n
By Him through whom we live,\n
A sacrifice of praise, O God,\n
The fruit of lips we give.\n\n
Remembering Thy Son,\n
Our praise to Thee ascends,\n
’Tis heaven’s song on earth begun,\n
The song that never ends.\n
Our hearts are tuned anew\n
As thus, with one accord,\n
That wealth of grace and truth we view,\n
Remembering our Lord.\n

101. Together at the feast,\n
A sacrifice we raise\n
To Thee, O God, through our great Priest\n
Who leads our hymn of praise.\n\n
Our hearts are occupied\n
With Thy beloved Son,\n
In whom Thou hast been glorified,\n
By whom Thy will was done.\n\n
Our eyes afresh survey\n
That path of purest grace,\n
And mark the beauties of His way,\n
That time shall ne’er efface.\n\n
Our minds recall again\n
Those words of grace so free,\n
Those mighty deeds of power, as when\n
He quelled the storm at sea.\n\n
Our hands we thus would fill\n
With gathered incense sweet\n
The fragrance inexpressible\n
That lingered round His feet.\n\n
Through Him, O God, we raise\n
In worship rev’rently,\n
United sacrifice of praise,\n
Acceptable to Thee.\n

102. Joyful, joyful, we adore Thee,\n
God of glory, Lord of love;\n
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee,\n
Opening to the sun above.\n

Drive the dark of doubt away;\n
Giver of immortal gladness,\n
Fill us with the light of day!\n\n
All Thy works with joy surround Thee,\n 
Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays,\n
Stars and angels sing around Thee,\n
Center of unbroken praise.\n
Field and forest, vale and mountain,\n 
Flowery meadow, flashing sea,\n
Singing bird and flowing fountain\n 
Call us to rejoice in Thee.\n\n
Thou art giving and forgiving,\n
Ever blessing, ever blessed,\n
Wellspring of the joy of living,\n 
Ocean depth of happy rest!\n
Thou our Father, Christ our brother,\n 
All who live in love are Thine;\n
Teach us how to love each other,\n 
Lift us to the joy divine.\n\n
Mortals, join the happy chorus,\n 
Which the morning stars began;\n
Father love is reigning o’er us,\n 
Brother love binds man to man.\n
Ever singing, march we onward,\n
Victors in the midst of strife,\n
Joyful music leads us Son-ward\n 
In the triumph song of life.\n

103. We believe in God, the Father,\n
We believe in Christ, the Son;\n
That the Holy Spirit guides us,\n
O the blessed three in One!\n
Praise the Lord for the atonement,\n
For the cross on Calv’ry’s hill,\n
Where our precious Saviour suffered\n
That He might fulfill God’s will.\n\n
Now He lives in heav’n to save us,\n
At God’s right hand ever more\n
Interceding to our Father;\n
Tell the story o’er and o’er\n
Sin’s dark hour hath passed forever\n 
For those who love our Saviour-King.\n
Holy Spirit, guide us, use us\n
That we other souls may bring.\n\n
Unto you a voice is calling,\n
Pleading that you come to Him;\n
Heed the invitation, brother,\n
Ere the lights of earth grow dim.\n
Endless joy to all is promised\n
Who accept our Lord divine;\n
Grace is yours in fullest measure,\n 
Hear Him say, ‘Come now, be mine!’\n\n

To a world by sin undone;\n
Jesus Christ was crucifled-\n
’Twas for sinners Jesus died.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, the glory of His grace,\n
Shining from the Saviour’s face!\n
Telling sinners from above,\n
‘God is Light’ and ‘God is Love.’\n\n
Sin and death no more shall reign,\n
Jesus died and lives again!\n
In the glory’s highest height-\n
See Him, God’s supreme delight.\n\n
All who in His name believe,\n
Everlasting life receive;\n
Lord of all is Jesus now,\n
Ev’ry knee to Him must bow.\n\n
Christ the Lord will come again,\n
He who suffered once will reign\n
Every tongue at last shall own,\n

His child and forever I am.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Redeemed, redeemed,\n
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;\n
Redeemed, redeemed,\n
His child and forever I am.\n\n
Redeemed, and so happy in Jesus,\n
No language my rapture can tell;\n
I know that the light of His presence\n
With me doth continually dwell.\n\n
I think of my blessèd Redeemer,\n
I think of Him all the day long:\n
I sing, for I cannot be silent;\n
His love is the theme of my song.\n\n
I know I shall see in His beauty\n
The King in whose law I delight\n
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps\n
And giveth me songs in the night.\n\n

106. Thou alone, Lord Jesus, canst true peace impart,\n
Thou dost know the sorrow of the human heart;\n
Thou who cam’st from glory here that heart to win,\n
And in love for sinners suffer’dst once for sin!\n
There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee,\n
For the broken-hearted there is none like Thee!\n\n
Hearts bowed down with sadness, laden with their sin,\n
Thro’ thy blood, Lord Jesus, boldly enter in;\n
Gladly hear Thee calling ‘Come to me and rest,’\n
‘Lose their heavy burden on Thy loving breast.\n
There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee,\n
For the heavy - laden there is none like Thee!\n\n
Worldly joy is fleeting – vanity itself;\n
Vain the dazzling brightness, vain the stores of wealth;\n
Vain the pomp and glory; only Thou canst give\n
Peace and satisfaction whilst on earth we live.\n
There is none, Lord Jesus, there is none like Thee,\n
For the soul that thirsteth there is none like Thee!\n


107. Who’d be found worthy, in the heavens or the earth\n
To pay the debt of sin for everyone,\n
Who could win the victory, over death hell and the grave\n
The Lion of the tribe of Judah, Jesus Christ the Son.\n\n

He alone is worthy, to worship and adore\n
The Lamb of God victorious, our risen Lord\n
He purchased our redemption, our righteousness is He\n
Exalt the name of Jesus, He is worthy.\n\n

You’ve set this captive free\n

‘Do this in remembrance of me.’\n\n
Though unworthy to eat of Thy life-giving bread,\n
Or to gather the crumbs as they fall;\n
We come through Thy merit and take of the feast,\n
In Thy mercy provided for all.\n\n
May our strength be renewed and our souls be impressed\n
With the scenes that by faith we behold;\n
And show forth the death of the Lord till He come,\n
And we rest in Thy glory untold.\n

135. The day returns, into His name,\n
O God, we gather thus\n
To give to Thee through Him who came\n
To make Thee known to us.\n\n
His glories great, His matchless worth,\n
In all His path we trace,\n
His life recall, His death tell forth,\n
And praise His love and grace.\n\n
Sweet are the accents to thine ear\n
That praise that worthy One\n
Whom we remember, gathered here,\n
Thy well-beloved Son.\n\n
The loaf and cup before us spread\n
The precious truths declare\n
His body giv’n, His blood thus shed,\n
His grace beyond compare\n\n
With such sweet symbols of His love\n
Laid thus before our gaze\n
Our hearts we lift to Thee above\n
In sacrifice of praise.\n
