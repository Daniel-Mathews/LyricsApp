    <string name="songDatabase">1. In tenderness He sought me,\n
Weary and sick with sin,\n
And on His shoulders brought me\n
Back to His fold again.\n
While angels in His presence sang\n
Until the courts of heaven rang.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Oh, the love that sought me\n
Oh, the blood that bought me\n
Oh the grace that brought me to the fold.\n
Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold.\n\n
He pointed to the nail-prints;\n
For me His blood was shed.\n
A mocking crown so thorny,\n
Was placed upon His head.\n
I wonder what He saw in me,\n
To suffer such deep agony.\n\n
I’m sitting in His presence;\n
The sunshine of His face,\n
While with adoring wonder\n
His wonders I retrace.\n
It seems as if eternal days\n
Are far too short to sound His praise.\n

2. O Lord my God! When I in awesome wonder\n
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made,\n
I see the stars; I hear the mighty thunder,\n
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee\n
How great thou art! How great Thou art!\n
Then sings my soul my Saviour God to Thee\n
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!\n\n
And when I think: that God, His Son not sparing\n
Sent Him to die - I scarce can take it in;\n
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing\n
He bled and died; to take away my sin.\n\n
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation\n
And take me home – what joy shall fill my heart.\n
Then shall I bow in humble adoration,\n
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art.\n

3. Great is Thy faithfulness, O God my Father,\n
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;\n
Thou changest not, Thy compassions they fail not,\n
As Thou hast been, Thou forever wilt be.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Great is Thy faithfulness, great is Thy faithfulness;\n
Morning by morning new mercies I see;\n
All I have needed Thy hand hath provided,\n
Great is Thy faithfulness, Lord, unto me.\n\n
Summer, and winter, and spring time, and harvest,\n
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above;\n
Join with all nature in manifold witness,\n
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.\n\n
Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,\n
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;\n
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,\n
Blessings all mine with ten thousand beside.\n

4. I hear the words of love,\n
I gaze upon the blood,\n
I see the mighty sacrifice,\n
And I have peace with God.\n\n
’Tis everlasting peace,\n
Sure as Jehovah’s name;\n
’Tis stable as His steadfast throne,\n
For evermore the same.\n\n
The clouds may go and come,\n
And storms may sweep my sky;\n
This blood - sealed friendship changes not,\n
The cross is ever nigh.\n\n
I change - He changes not;\n
The Christ can never die;\n
His love, not mine, the resting - place;\n
His truth, not mine, the tie.\n\n
My love is oft - times low,\n
My joy still ebbs and flows;\n
But peace with Him remains the same,\n
No change Jehovah knows.\n

5. Holy, holy, holy! Lord\n
God of Hosts! When heav’n and earth,\n
Out of darkness, at Thy Word,\n
Issued into glorious birth,\n
All Thy works before Thee stood,\n
And Thine eye beheld them good,\n
While they sang with sweet accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy, Lord!\n\n
Holy, holy, holy! Thee\n
One Jehovah evermore,\n
Father, Son, and Spirit, we\n
Dust and ashes, would adore;\n
Lightly by the world esteemed,\n
From that world by Thee redeemed,\n
Sing we here with glad accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy Lord!\n\n
Holy, holy, holy! All\n
Heaven’s triumphant choirs shall sing\n
When the ransomed nations fall\n
At the footstool of their King:\n
Then shall saints and seraphim,\n
Hearts and voices, swell one hymn,\n
Round the throne with full accord,\n
Holy, holy, holy Lord!\n

6. My God, how wonderful Thou art,\n
Thy majesty, how bright;\n
How beautiful Thy mercy seat,\n
In depths of burning light!\n
How dread are Thy eternal years,\n
O everlasting Lord;\n
By prostrate spirits day and night,\n
Incessantly adored!\n\n
How wonderful, how beautiful,\n
The sight of Thee must be;\n
Thy endless wisdom, boundless power,\n
And glorious purity!\n
O how I fear Thee, living God,\n
With deep and tender fear;\n
And worship Thee with trembling hope,\n
And penitential tears!n\n
No earthly father loves like Thee,\n
No mother, e’er so mild,\n
Bears and forbears as Thou hast done,\n
With me, Thy sinful child.\n
Father of Jesus, love’s reward!\n
What rapture it will be\n
Prostrate before Thy throne to be,\n
And gaze, and gaze on Thee!\n

7. There’s a wideness in God’s mercy,\n
Like the wideness of the sea;\n
There’s a kindness in His justice,\n
Which is more than liberty.\n\n
There is no place where earth’s sorrows\n
Are more felt than up in heaven;\n
There is no place where earth’s failings\n
Have such kindly judgment given.\n\n
There is welcome for the sinner,\n
And more graces for the good;\n
There is mercy with the Saviour;\n
There is healing in His blood.\n\n
There is plentiful redemption\n
In the blood that has been shed;\n
There is joy for all the members\n
In the sorrows of the head.\n\n
For the love of God is broader\n
Than the measure of our mind;\n
And the heart of the Eternal\n
Is most wonderfully kind.\n

8. The love of God is greater far,\n
Than tongue or pen can ever tell;\n
It goes beyond the highest star,\n
And reaches to the lowest hell;\n
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,\n
God gave His Son to win;\n
His erring child He reconciled,\n
And pardoned from his sin.\n\n
Chorus:\n
O love of God, how rich and pure!\n
How measureless and strong!\n
It shall forevermore endure\n
The saints’ and angels’ song.\n\n
When years of time shall pass away,\n
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;\n
When men, who here refuse to pray,\n
On rocks and hills and mountains call;\n
God’s love so sure, shall still endure,\n
All measureless and strong;\n
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race\n
The saints’ and angels’ song.\n\n
Could we with ink the ocean fill,\n
And were the skies of parchment made,\n
Were every stalk on earth a quill,\n
And every man a scribe by trade,\n
To write the love of God above,\n
Would drain the ocean dry.\n
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,\n
Though stretched from sky to sky.\n

9. O God, Thy power is wonderful,\n
Thy glory passing bright;\n
Thy wisdom, with its deep on deep,\n
A rapture to the sight.\n\n
Angelic spirits, countless souls,\n
Of Thee have drunk their fill;\n
And to eternity will drink\n
Thy joy and glory still\n\n
I see Thee in the eternal years\n
In glory all alone,\n
Ere round Thine uncreated fires\n
Created light had shone.\n\n
I see Thee walk in Eden’s shade,\n
I see Thee all through time;\n
Thy patience and compassion seem\n
New attributes sublime.\n\n
I see Thee when the doom is o’er,\n
And outworn time is done,\n
Still, still incomprehensible,\n
O God, yet not alone.\n

10. Far above all is our Saviour enthroned;\n
Crowned is the Lamb, who for sinners atoned,\n
Living for ever to answer our call,\n
God hath exalted Him far above all.\n\n
Chorus:\n
Far above all! Far above all!\n
‘Jesus the crucified’ far above all!\n
Low at His footstool adoring we fall,\n
God hath exalted Him far above all!\n\n
His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,\n
Far above all while the ages shall roll,\n
With Him the victors, who followed His call,\n
Share in His royalty far above all.\n</string>
